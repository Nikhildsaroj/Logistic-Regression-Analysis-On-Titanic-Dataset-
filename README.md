## Logistic Regression Analysis (On Titanic Dataset)

### Description:
This repository contains a logistic regression analysis conducted on the Titanic dataset, consisting of 1000 data points. The project aims to predict survival outcomes based on various passenger attributes using machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression.

### Key Details:
- **Dataset:** Titanic dataset with 1000 data points.
- **Algorithm Used:** Logistic Regression
- **Training Accuracy:** 0.80%
- **Testing Accuracy:** 0.79%

### Project Overview:
The project involves preprocessing the dataset, including handling missing values and feature engineering as necessary. Logistic regression models are trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated for their predictive performance using the remaining data. The achieved training accuracy of 0.80 and testing accuracy of 0.79 demonstrate the effectiveness of the logistic regression model in predicting survival outcomes for Titanic passengers.

### Repository Contents:
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Contains the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Dataset File:** Includes the Titanic dataset used for analysis.

### Instructions:
To replicate the analysis and explore the predictive capabilities of logistic regression on the Titanic dataset, clone this repository and run the provided Jupyter Notebook. Feel free to experiment with different features and parameters to further enhance the model's performance.
